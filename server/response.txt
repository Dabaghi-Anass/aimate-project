## HTML (index.html)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<head>
  <title>Cube Drawing</title>
  <style>
    body {
      margin: 0;
      overflow: hidden;
    }
    canvas {
      background-color: #f0f0f0;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation:**

1. **HTML:** Sets up a canvas element with an ID "myCanvas" and links the "script.js" file.
2. **Javascript:**
   - Gets the canvas and its context.
   - Sets the canvas size to the window size.
   - Defines the cube dimensions, vertices, and edges.
   - Defines a projection matrix to simulate a perspective projection.
   - Implements a `project` function to transform 3D coordinates to 2D.
   - Implements a `drawCube` function:
     - Clears the canvas.
     - Sets line style and width.
     - Projects vertices to 2D.
     - Iterates through edges and draws lines connecting projected vertices.
   - Calls `drawCube` initially to draw the cube.

**To run the code:**

1. Create two files: `index.html` and `script.js`.
2. Paste the corresponding code into each file.
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

You should see a simple wireframe cube drawn in the canvas. You can adjust the `cubeSize` variable to change the size of the cube, and experiment with different projection matrices to create different visual effects.
